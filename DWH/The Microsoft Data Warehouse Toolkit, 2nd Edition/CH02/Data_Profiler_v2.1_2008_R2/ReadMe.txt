Disclaimer
----------
This report set is meant to provide an example of data profiling. It is a simple data profiler with limited functionality. It assumes the user has appropriate privileges and does little error checking. Use at your own risk.


Instructions
------------
1) Open the Data Profiler v2 Reporting Services solution.  Change the target reporting services directory if necessary, and change the TempDB.rds shared data source if you want it to point to a server other the localhost.
2) Deploy the project.
3) Go to the Report Manager and test the reports. Remember, they may take a while to run if your tables are particularly large.  You should be able to examine any table in any database to which your ID has permission.

Enhancements
------------
These reports could be a lot better. Please let us know if you create any useful enhancements or extensions to this report set.
